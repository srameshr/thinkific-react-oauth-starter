# Thinkific OAuth React CRA Starter

This is a boilerplate to setup a React CRA application to request access token from a Thinkific Site.

## Prerequisites

You will need the credentials for your app created in Thinkific Platform.

- client_id: App's client id;
- redirect_uri: App's registered callback uri. For this project will be your app's url + `/callback`. i.e `your-domain.com/thinkific/callback`

## Description

This starte kit gives you a CRA React app with React Router and Chakra UI that adds two screens:
1. `http://localhost:3000/thinkific/authorize`
2. `http://localhost:3000/thinkfiic/callback`

These two routes comes with the UI and logic to 
1. Take the Thinkific site domain from the user via `/thinkific/authorize` route
2. Authorize the Thinkific site
3. Handle the redirect via `/thinkific/callback` route
4. Generate access token and expiry date and then store it in localstorage with the name `thinkificAccessToken` and `thinkificAccessTokenExpiresAt`

## Project setup

Modify `.env.development` file as well as `.env.production` file with appropriate values

```
REACT_APP_THINKIFIC_CLIENT_ID=xxxxx
REACT_APP_THINKIFIC_CALLBACK_URL_HOST=https://yoursiterunningtheapp.com
```

Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
